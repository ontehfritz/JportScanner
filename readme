JPortScanner alpha v0.3
__________________________
Requirements:

JRE 1.4.x or Java SDK 1.4.x get it at ----> www.javasoft.com 

Running the port Scanner:

Go to the directory of the file and ----

*nix:
1.In console window type: java -jar <filename> 

Windows:
1. In console window type java: -jar <filename>
2. If you aren't a butt head and set up the jre right you should be able to double click the jar file
just as you would an executable.

XP or 98 WARNING: I have found the speed issue that is on some versions of M$ windows! It is how it handles
multi-threading. In release 0.4a this will no longer be an issue.

(JPortScanner does not run optimized on XP and 98. Actually it runs like shit on XP compared to *nix
this is NOT because of java, other port scanners I have tried run slow as well it has something to do with 
settings in XP/98 and I hope to resolve this issue soon!)

Next Release v0.4a 
_______________________
1.Improved user interface(again)
2.Port Debugging/description(in this version for sure)
3.Fix the small bugs I know are there
4.Improve threading for windows(fucking M$)
